But, with the current setup in place, I wanted to use more benchmarks, specifically some of the ones mentioned in the Pythia paper to cross-reference whether the evaluation pipeline itself is correct. Also, if that were to be the case, we would build a more informationally speaking, rich benchmarking report. Additionally, big 1.4B models will report ARC-Easy results, too.\n",
