    "### Document Embedding Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- MiniPile paper uses term \"document\": This refers to individual training examples from \"The Pile-Deduplicated\"\n",
    "- \"The Pile Deduplicated\" predominantly contains english text, as stated in the Pile paper\n",
    "- `E5-Large` does not require performing sentence-splitting beforehand, I was misguided by the example code at https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-large\n",
    "- `E5-Large` scales poorly to the dataset size under the conditions imposed by the HU Berlin cluster. I will use `E5-Base-4k` instead.\n",
    "- `E5-Base-4k` performs slightly worse than `E5-Large`, but has roughly half the parameter count and is therefore more efficient to use\n",
    "- We attempt to mitigate the reported/expectable performance losses by using a larger text window size of $1024$ tokens instead of the $512$ tokens used by `E5-Large` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the smaller model and The Pile, we iterate through the dataset and extract the embedding for each document.<br>\n",
    "The script I initially implemented for the embedding step is `03_embed_pile_dedup.py`.<br>\n",
    "The approach layed out therein conceptually worked, but it had to be thoroughly memory-optimized to run for as long as needed for our Pile dataset.<br>\n",
    "The optimized script I ultimately ran for this step is `03_embed_pile_dedup_turbo.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding step produces as artifact a copy of the original dataset with the embeddings added as a column.<br>\n",
    "The embedding process is resumable, results are persisted in multiple parquet files, one after another, in the folder `Pile_Deduplicated_Embd`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that I intended to upload this embedded version of the Pile to HuggingFace for strict reproducibility.**<br>\n",
    "**This idea was cut short by a change in HuggingFace's pricing policy, effective January 2025, prohibiting the free sharing of datasets >500GB - a threshold which this new dataset crosses (801 GB) due to the added embeddings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, note that the embedding step, through its parallel processing, is in no way guaranteed to maintain the original order of the documents.<br>\n",
    "In fact, this is the reason for why I elected to build the dataset copy with the embeddings as a column in the first place, to ensure the correct alignment of the embeddings with the documents while still being able to leverage parallel processing. Because, after all, time was the deciding factor.<br>\n",
    "The shuffling is therefore not a problem as such, but we have to base the clustering and therefore all following processes on this new, shuffled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, all artifacts produced after the embedding step will relate not to the original dataset, but the embedded dataset, e.g. when referring to entries by index."

    "### Clustering of Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Batchified $k$-means clustering, a term only used in the MiniPile paper: This must stand for **mini-batch k-means clustering**\n",
    "- Cosine distance between normalized embeddings\n",
    "- Cluster Count of $k=220$ ($10$ clusters per source)\n",
    "- Batch size $16384$\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecturally, I built the clustering step to be fully independent of the embedding step, so as to be able to run the partial fitting concurrently with the latter, saving ~4 days of processing time total.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clustering step is implemented in `03_cluster_pile_embed.py`. As soon as the embedding step finishes, a text file is produced, signaling the clustering step to conclude model fitting and start predicting. The centroids are saved and can be found in `MiniPile_BatchKMeans/cluster_centers.npy`. Intermediary centroid results have been omitted from this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each embedding from the newly created dataset is assigned to one of the $220$ clusters. This cluster information as well as the distance of the data point to the centroid are stored in JSONL files, with the entries in order of appearance in the embedded Pile dataset.<br>\n",
    "Each clustering result looks like this: `{\"idx\": 0, \"cluster\": 5, \"distance\": 0.20949329195756128}`.<br>\n",
    "Each Pile-Embedded document is referred to only by its index, crunching the cluster results' memory requirements down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the JSONL files containing the cluster assignments, the clustering step produces a verification file `MiniPile_BatchKMeans/cluster_results_metadata.json` to indicate whether all chunks and all data points therein have been processed and how results have been saved. We can see from this file that the original dataset size of $134,318,121$ documents has been captured and thus processed, lending more credibility to the clustering results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the clustering step produces a file `MiniPile_BatchKMeans/cluster_info_for_inspection.json`.<br>\n",
    "Per cluster index, this file contains the following information:\n",
    "- `closest`: The top 5 closest documents to the cluster centroid\n",
    "    - `text`: The associated text excerpt (for memory reasons)\n",
    "    - `distance`: The cosine distance to the cluster centroid\n",
    "- `farthest`: The top 5 farthest documents from the cluster centroid (again, excerpts, in same format)\n",
    "- `total_examples`: The number of documents assigned to this cluster\n",
    "- `average_distance`: The average cosine distance of all documents to the cluster centroid\n",
    "- `sum_distance`: The sum of all cosine distances of all documents to the cluster centroid\n",
    "\n",
    "The three latter information points are intended to help with the human-guided exclusion of unwanted clusters, but moreover, they may help in improving the dataset creation process later on, as they can provide insights into the spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these files were attained, I ran `03_sort_pile_clusters.py` to save the cluster assignment entries organized into one file per cluster / separated by cluster. This is to facilitate a more effective cluster exclusion process during later minipile creation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the clustering step is concluded, producing one JSONL file per cluster with information about each cluster assignment per document.<br>\n",
    "This intermediary dataset can be found here: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/Marcus2112/pile_dedup_embeddings_clusters](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Marcus2112/pile_dedup_embeddings_clusters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while the entry count is exactly identical, the size is not. Where the original MiniPile occupied $3.14GB$, we now require $3.71GB$.\n",
    "Several factors play into this:\n",
    "- We use a slightly different embedding model, which may cause (at least occasional) devations in embedding and thus may lead to differently shaped clusters\n",
    "- We select clusters by hand, allowing interpretation of selection categories to roam free. I thus may have selected $38$ clusters according to the paper's categories, but my understanding of enforcing them during selection may differ from the author.\n",
    "- The random sampling happened to select different examples per cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, note that these indices are not per-se applicable to the original dataset, but to the embedded dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Human-Guided Cluster Exclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, especially due to the `MiniPile_BatchKMeans/cluster_info_for_inspection.json` file, we can start the human-guided exclusion of unwanted clusters.<br>\n",
    "I strictly adhered to the paper and only sorted out clusters of the layed out categories, which I found to be well identifyable through the 10 examples per cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The categories with the clusters I sorted out are as follows:\n",
    "- Near Duplicates ($10, 15, 16, 22, 26, 28, 35, 37, 46, 51, 57, 64, 86, 87, 64, 102, 111, 114, 152, 163, 166, 218$)\n",
    "- Pornography ($167$)\n",
    "- Navigation Bars ($39, 88, 101, 155$)\n",
    "- Product Specifications ($61, 200$)\n",
    "- Long lists of named entities ($40, 44, 78, 90, 99, 103, 181, 196, 219$)\n",
    "\n",
    "### MiniPile Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "With the cluster analysis concluded, we can now proceed to the distillation of the MiniPile dataset.<br>\n",
    "This dataset touches on all the artifacts produced in the previous steps:<br>\n",
    "- The embedded Pile dataset, from which we extract the documents\n",
    "- The cluster assignments, from which we extract the documents assigned to the remaining clusters\n",
    "- The cluster exclusion list, from which we exclude the documents assigned to the unwanted clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "The distillation step is implemented in `03_distill_pile_embed.py`.<br>\n",
    "The script is written to most exactly and efficiently (we have loads of I/O to perform) extract the correct documents according to our random sampling across the remaining clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distillation step produces a new dataset, the MiniPile, which is a subset of the original Pile dataset.<br>\n",
    "The created dataset is exactly $1,010,500$ documents large, as intended. The dataset is shuffled, to spread cluster entries evenly across the dataset's splits.<br>\n",
    "Additionally, I added a column `pile_idx` to each entry, denoting the original index of the document in the Pile dataset.<br>\n",
    "This helped in making sure that the dataset actually captures a subset derived from across the entire embedded Pile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting self-created MiniPile can be found here: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/Marcus2112/minipile_recreation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Marcus2112/minipile_recreation).\n",
    "\n",
    "I now went on and adapted the `02_train_160M.py` script to train Pythia $160\\text{M}$ on the newly created MiniPile.<br>\n",

I distinctly chose to use a small proxy model for this.

This implies that the measures taken unwittingly during the reproduction process pose a more effective set of improvements than the loss-informed sampling approach itself additionally provides, if it does at all. These measures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The embedding process, which during the Recreation uses a slightly worse model than the original MiniPile, but processes larger context sizes for the embeddings (1024 instead of 512)\n",

While loss can be considered a related indicator, it is not a direct measure of informativeness.\n",

    "Taking a step back with this insight, we should re-focus that MiniPile's goal is to capture the most representative subset of the 'insights' gainable from the original Pile dataset. To achieve that, we can look at diversity, which could improve generalization, especially when requiring broad informational coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, sampling inversely proportional to the cluster density will prioritize sparse regions of the dataset and thus the gaining of a broad coverage of the dataset's information. However, as lunch is never free, over-sampling/representing sparse clusters will likely introduce noise, especially when cluster sparsity correlates with low-quality examples. One could argue that we already excluded the most uninteresting, thus noise-inducing clusters, but the potential for noise itself is in no way mitigated (/mitigatable?). Density-based sampling therefore has to be understood as a trade-off between spread for representation and accidental capturing of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "And still, density-based sampling could be helpful in capturing a most diverse set of examples, which in turn could be beneficial for generalization.\n",
    "But, we have to find a way to mitigate noise and over-representation at least to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "I therefore propose a density-based sampling approach that calculates cluster contribution proportions like so:\n",
    "$$\\text{Cluster Proportion} = \\frac{|C_i|}{|\\bigcup_{j} C_j|} \\cdot (1 - \\omega \\cdot \\rho(C_i))$$\n",

    "### Idea 4 - Increasing $k$ for Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the results of ideas 1 to 3, we can see that the reproduction in itself already is a strong improvement over the original MiniPile. It is such a strong improvement in fact, that the sampling and arrangement ideas seemingly only marginally improve the dataset over the reproduction, if at all. This implies that the clustering process itself should be investigated for potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revisiting the K-Means clustering process, it became evident that the number of clusters $k$ chosen by the paper was chosen somewhat arbitrarily. While the deduplicated Pile consists of $220$ data subsets, this doesn't mean that $k = 220$ is the optimal choice for the clustering process, neglecting e.g. the potential for capturing of finer group structures within subsets, which would in turn enable more detailed document selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate if a higher number of clusters could lead to a more representative dataset, $k$ was increased from $220$ to $440$.\n",
    "We can't however couple the doubling of $k$ with the expectation of doubling the number of clusters to be excluded. Clusters may be excluded only if they fit to the paper's original criteria. By these measures, a total of $70$ clusters were excluded from the dataset. Other parameters were kept unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "For dataset distillation, the reproduction code with an increased $k$ value was used.<br>\n",
    "The trained model can be found here: \n",

    "### Cancelled Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's constraints for time and resource availability needed to be considered during the pursuit of different improvement ideas.\n",
    "As MiniPile itself is designed purposefully to be applied in academic settings, ideally, its creation should be feasible within this same setting as well.\n",
    "However, techniques like HDBSCAN clustering, which could potentially improve the clustering process, require more time and resources than could be deemed feasible for this project. The following ideas have been cancelled due to these constraints, but have been added in the `cancelled_ideas` folder and may be worth investigating in future projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HDBSCAN clustering:** Replacing K-Means with HDBSCAN could help in identifying complex-shaped clusters, as well as outliers\n",
    "- **Lossi 3:** The loss-based sampling approach could have been improved further by using the proxy model during a second loss-based selection strategy. Where the cluster proportions where governed by losses already, the samples themselves could have been, too. For that, we would sample $1.5\\times$ the proportion per cluster and measure each example's loss with the proxy. From that, from a list sorted by loss in descending order, we would pick the top as $0.8\\times$ of the proportion and the lower as $0.2\\times$ of the proportion. This would have been a more fine-grained approach to the loss-based sampling idea, but loss itself is was deemed not a suitable measure, because it tends to favor complexity over information content, even with the $0.2\\times$ lower complexity proportion.\n",
    "- **Density-based sampling with $\\omega = 0.25$:** This approach was discarded to save time. In effect, the cluster size-proportioned sampling approach provided a reference for an $\\omega = 0.00$ setting already. More interest was therefore put into lower-density-based sampling, resulting in the tests with $\\omega=0.75$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above ideas were cancelled during the implementation phase, others were put aside during brainstorming for similar reasons (feasibility within constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sparse Sampling of Embeddings with Similarity Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea arose from the Lossi 3 cancellation and aims to improve the dataset creation process specifically without the need for a proxy model. This idea applies Locality Sensitive Hashing to the clusters resulting from the K-Means clustering step. Per cluster, LSH would hash embeddings into buckets based on similarity, potentially capturing more detailed relationships between documents than would be possible by K-Means clusters alone. Note that I would keep K-Means in place and would not replace it with LSH, as K-Means poses an overall low-cost grouping option allowing for human-guided filtering. Also, using LSH on cluster-level may help with resource usage. (This choice can admittedly be seen as a shortcoming as we don't leverage LSH's full potential of capturing relationships even across clusters, yet clustwe-wise handling would be more likely to execute.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Per cluster, LSH hashes embeddings into similarity-based buckets (e.g. $16$ buckets, arbitrarily). We'd attain $16$ sub-clusters per cluster by similarity and it is across these that we would sample from the cluster. Sampling could thus be more informed of inner-cluster topology. Still, sampling itself would not solely rely on LSH, but treat it as one of three configurably weighted factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proportional Sampling:** As in Idea 1, we would sample documents proportional to cluster sizes, enabling capture of original dataset distribution.\n",
    "- **Random Exploration:** Introduces 'total' inner-cluster randomness to capture some potentially unique or median examples.\n",
    "- **Semantic Diversity Sampling:** Prioritizes semantically diverse examples using LSH-based similarity groups, aiming at capturing more detailed relationships between documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rest of assembly would equal the implemented ideas.<br>\n",
    "I've read that the python framework `faiss` is praised for being efficient in LSH-based similarity hashing. Maybe this would be a good starting point.<br>\n",
    "This is what I stumbled across while researching LSH and its applications and what might be interesting:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Double-Proxied Cross-Entropy-based Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea would be closely aligned with the findings of [Extracting representative subset from extensive text data for\n",
    "training pre-trained language models (Suzuki, et al. 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457322003508). The authors claim that \"[...] the representative subset obtained using [a] likelihood difference score can achieve the 90% performance level even when the size of the dataset is reduced to approximately two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the original dataset\".<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach scores and ranks data samples based on the likelihood difference between two differently pretrained language models (PreLMs):\n",
    "1. An in-domain PreLM, trained on domain-specific data, i.e. a conceptually interrelated subset of the larger dataset\n",
    "2. A non-domain PreLM, trained on a general domain, i.e. the full dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For each document $X$, the likelihood difference score $S(X)$ is calculated as:\n",
    "$$S(X)=\\overline{H}^{(I)}(X) - \\overline{H}^{(N)}(X)$$\n",
    "$\\overline{H}^{(I)}$ and $\\overline{H}^{(N)}$ are the normalized per-word cross-entropy losses from in-domain PreLM and non-domain PreLM, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, we would:\n",
    "1. Calculate $S(X)$ for all documents in the dataset.\n",
    "2. Rank documents in ascending order of $S(X)$.\n",
    "3. Deduplicate redundant samples (I'd argue this is not necessary for The Pile Deduplicated).\n",
    "4. Selecting the top-$K$ ranked samples as representative dataset (RepSet).\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be interesting to follow up on the paper's claims, but I'd fear this is a resource-intense and in the end still loss-based approach, overrepresenting compliated and not representing/informative documents in the final assembly. Further, this approach poses a catch 22, because in order to train more cost-effective, we have to train the non-domain PreLM on the full dataset. For a constrained academic setting, this might not be possible, even if the proxy model size is downscaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic Deduplication as Post-Processing for the distilled dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "An idea for a post-processing step would be to analyze the now smaller subset for semantic duplicates. I'd suggest the works of [SemDeDup: Data-efficient learning at web-scale through semantic deduplication (Abbas, et al. 2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09540) for this semantic deduplication. It is claimed that for the LAION dataset, \"[...] SemDeDup can remove 50% of the data with minimal performance loss\". This could be a valuable step to further reduce the dataset size without losing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this idea is interesting, I was hesitant to allocate resources to it, mostly because reducing the distillate solely by the perspective of semantic similarity might remove syntactically informative, yet semantically similar examples. This could lead to a loss of diversity in the dataset, which is not necessarily desirable. However, testing could be done relatively flexibly, as this can be put into action post-assembly."
