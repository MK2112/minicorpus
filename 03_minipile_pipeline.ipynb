    "### Document Embedding Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- MiniPile paper uses term \"document\": This refers to individual training examples from \"The Pile-Deduplicated\"\n",
    "- \"The Pile Deduplicated\" predominantly contains english text, as stated in the Pile paper\n",
    "- `E5-Large` does not require performing sentence-splitting beforehand, I was misguided by the example code at https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-large\n",
    "- `E5-Large` scales poorly to the dataset size under the conditions imposed by the HU Berlin cluster. I will use `E5-Base-4k` instead.\n",
    "- `E5-Base-4k` performs slightly worse than `E5-Large`, but has roughly half the parameter count and is therefore more efficient to use\n",
    "- We attempt to mitigate the reported/expectable performance losses by using a larger text window size of $1024$ tokens instead of the $512$ tokens used by `E5-Large` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the smaller model and The Pile, we iterate through the dataset and extract the embedding for each document.<br>\n",
    "The script I initially implemented for the embedding step is `03_embed_pile_dedup.py`.<br>\n",
    "The approach layed out therein conceptually worked, but it had to be thoroughly memory-optimized to run for as long as needed for our Pile dataset.<br>\n",
    "The optimized script I ultimately ran for this step is `03_embed_pile_dedup_turbo.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding step produces as artifact a copy of the original dataset with the embeddings added as a column.<br>\n",
    "The embedding process is resumable, results are persisted in multiple parquet files, one after another, in the folder `Pile_Deduplicated_Embd`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that I intended to upload this embedded version of the Pile to HuggingFace for strict reproducibility.**<br>\n",
    "**This idea was cut short by a change in HuggingFace's pricing policy, effective January 2025, prohibiting the free sharing of datasets >500GB - a threshold which this new dataset crosses (801 GB) due to the added embeddings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, note that the embedding step, through its parallel processing, is in no way guaranteed to maintain the original order of the documents.<br>\n",
    "In fact, this is the reason for why I elected to build the dataset copy with the embeddings as a column in the first place, to ensure the correct alignment of the embeddings with the documents while still being able to leverage parallel processing. Because, after all, time was the deciding factor.<br>\n",
    "The shuffling is therefore not a problem as such, but we have to base the clustering and therefore all following processes on this new, shuffled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, all artifacts produced after the embedding step will relate not to the original dataset, but the embedded dataset, e.g. when referring to entries by index."

    "### Clustering of Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Batchified $k$-means clustering, a term only used in the MiniPile paper: This must stand for **mini-batch k-means clustering**\n",
    "- Cosine distance between normalized embeddings\n",
    "- Cluster Count of $k=220$ ($10$ clusters per source)\n",
    "- Batch size $16384$\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecturally, I built the clustering step to be fully independent of the embedding step, so as to be able to run the partial fitting concurrently with the latter, saving ~4 days of processing time total.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clustering step is implemented in `03_cluster_pile_embed.py`. As soon as the embedding step finishes, a text file is produced, signaling the clustering step to conclude model fitting and start predicting. The centroids are saved and can be found in `MiniPile_BatchKMeans/cluster_centers.npy`. Intermediary centroid results have been omitted from this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each embedding from the newly created dataset is assigned to one of the $220$ clusters. This cluster information as well as the distance of the data point to the centroid are stored in JSONL files, with the entries in order of appearance in the embedded Pile dataset.<br>\n",
    "Each clustering result looks like this: `{\"idx\": 0, \"cluster\": 5, \"distance\": 0.20949329195756128}`.<br>\n",
    "Each Pile-Embedded document is referred to only by its index, crunching the cluster results' memory requirements down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the JSONL files containing the cluster assignments, the clustering step produces a verification file `MiniPile_BatchKMeans/cluster_results_metadata.json` to indicate whether all chunks and all data points therein have been processed and how results have been saved. We can see from this file that the original dataset size of $134,318,121$ documents has been captured and thus processed, lending more credibility to the clustering results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the clustering step produces a file `MiniPile_BatchKMeans/cluster_info_for_inspection.json`.<br>\n",
    "Per cluster index, this file contains the following information:\n",
    "- `closest`: The top 5 closest documents to the cluster centroid\n",
    "    - `text`: The associated text excerpt (for memory reasons)\n",
    "    - `distance`: The cosine distance to the cluster centroid\n",
    "- `farthest`: The top 5 farthest documents from the cluster centroid (again, excerpts, in same format)\n",
    "- `total_examples`: The number of documents assigned to this cluster\n",
    "- `average_distance`: The average cosine distance of all documents to the cluster centroid\n",
    "- `sum_distance`: The sum of all cosine distances of all documents to the cluster centroid\n",
    "\n",
    "The three latter information points are intended to help with the human-guided exclusion of unwanted clusters, but moreover, they may help in improving the dataset creation process later on, as they can provide insights into the spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these files were attained, I ran `03_sort_pile_clusters.py` to save the cluster assignment entries organized into one file per cluster / separated by cluster. This is to facilitate a more effective cluster exclusion process during later minipile creation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the clustering step is concluded, producing one JSONL file per cluster with information about each cluster assignment per document.<br>\n",
    "This intermediary dataset can be found here: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/Marcus2112/pile_dedup_embeddings_clusters](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Marcus2112/pile_dedup_embeddings_clusters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while the entry count is exactly identical, the size is not. Where the original MiniPile occupied $3.14GB$, we now require $3.71GB$.\n",
    "Several factors play into this:\n",
    "- We use a slightly different embedding model, which may cause (at least occasional) devations in embedding and thus may lead to differently shaped clusters\n",
    "- We select clusters by hand, allowing interpretation of selection categories to roam free. I thus may have selected $38$ clusters according to the paper's categories, but my understanding of enforcing them during selection may differ from the author.\n",
    "- The random sampling happened to select different examples per cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, note that these indices are not per-se applicable to the original dataset, but to the embedded dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Human-Guided Cluster Exclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, especially due to the `MiniPile_BatchKMeans/cluster_info_for_inspection.json` file, we can start the human-guided exclusion of unwanted clusters.<br>\n",
    "I strictly adhered to the paper and only sorted out clusters of the layed out categories, which I found to be well identifyable through the 10 examples per cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The categories with the clusters I sorted out are as follows:\n",
    "- Near Duplicates ($10, 15, 16, 22, 26, 28, 35, 37, 46, 51, 57, 64, 86, 87, 64, 102, 111, 114, 152, 163, 166, 218$)\n",
    "- Pornography ($167$)\n",
    "- Navigation Bars ($39, 88, 101, 155$)\n",
    "- Product Specifications ($61, 200$)\n",
    "- Long lists of named entities ($40, 44, 78, 90, 99, 103, 181, 196, 219$)\n",
    "\n",
    "### MiniPile Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "With the cluster analysis concluded, we can now proceed to the distillation of the MiniPile dataset.<br>\n",
    "This dataset touches on all the artifacts produced in the previous steps:<br>\n",
    "- The embedded Pile dataset, from which we extract the documents\n",
    "- The cluster assignments, from which we extract the documents assigned to the remaining clusters\n",
    "- The cluster exclusion list, from which we exclude the documents assigned to the unwanted clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "The distillation step is implemented in `03_distill_pile_embed.py`.<br>\n",
    "The script is written to most exactly and efficiently (we have loads of I/O to perform) extract the correct documents according to our random sampling across the remaining clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distillation step produces a new dataset, the MiniPile, which is a subset of the original Pile dataset.<br>\n",
    "The created dataset is exactly $1,010,500$ documents large, as intended. The dataset is shuffled, to spread cluster entries evenly across the dataset's splits.<br>\n",
    "Additionally, I added a column `pile_idx` to each entry, denoting the original index of the document in the Pile dataset.<br>\n",
    "This helped in making sure that the dataset actually captures a subset derived from across the entire embedded Pile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting self-created MiniPile can be found here: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/Marcus2112/minipile_recreation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Marcus2112/minipile_recreation).\n",
    "\n",
    "I now went on and adapted the `02_train_160M.py` script to train Pythia $160\\text{M}$ on the newly created MiniPile.<br>\n",

We can do this at two points during dataset assembly, which is why idea 2.1 investiagtes the first point, and idea 2.2 the first with the second point combined. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Idea 2.1** covers these adaptations:\n",
    "- Per cluster: Uniformly sample $n$ (e.g. $1,000$) documents and determine their loss with a small Pythia $70\\text{M}$ proxy model\n",
    "- Use the mean loss as a heuristic for the cluster's informativeness and weight the cluster's representation in the final dataset by this value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea 2.2** covers these adaptations:\n",
    "- The loss-proportional sampling information from Idea 2.1 is used to guide the cluster-wise random sampling process\n",
    "- Per cluster: Randomly sample $1.5\\times$ the amount of documents we want to end up with from each non-excluded cluster\n",
    "- Per cluster: Calculate the loss for each sampled document with a small Pythia $70\\text{M}$ proxy model which itself was pretrained halfway through (`step72000`) The Pile Deduped.\n",
    "- Per cluster: Sort the documents by their loss and select the top half of the documents with the highest loss for the final dataset\n",
    "- We continue with the dataset assembly as before after that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we do this information-sorted slicing per each cluster and *not* globally as to still represent the cluster distribution in the final dataset. Otherwise, some clusters might not be represented at all anymore, because other cluster's examples just plainly induced more perplexity in the proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that we select the smallest Pythia model trained half-way through the Pile, which assumes that the Pile is shuffled with regards to cluster assignments.<br>\n",
    "We can verify that this is the case by looking at the unsorted cluster assignment results, written in order of appearance of documents in the embedded Pile dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I distinctly chose to use a small proxy model for this. MiniPile was intended for use in constrained academic settings, so we have to make do with small models that are most universally trainable, while not being too small as not to allow for their proxy use. Same goes for why the $70\\text{M}$ model is only trained to half of the full Pile dataset.\n",

    "We observe a clear improvement over the original MiniPile. However, we can't attribute that to the loss-informed sampling approach, as the Recreation dataset is remarkably equal in performance. This implies that the measures taken unwittingly during the recreation process pose a more effective set of improvements than the loss-informed sampling approach itself. These measures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The embedding process, which during the Recreation uses a slightly worse model than the original MiniPile, but processes larger context sizes for the embeddings (1024 instead of 512)\n",
    "- The clustering process, which may induce different cluster formations based on the different embeddings\n",
    "- The interpretability inherent in the cluster exclusion process, which may have led to a more effective dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This can imply that changes in the embedding and clustering process may be more effective than the loss-informed sampling approach itself.<br>\n",
    "I conclude that it is quite surprising that scaling the cluster proportions based on perceived informativeness doesn't yield a clear improvement over the uniform sampling approach. This may be due to the fact that the proxy model is not able to capture the full complexity of the dataset, and thus the loss-informed sampling approach may not be able to capture the most informative examples. This in turn would put the loss-informed sampling approach at a disadvantage compared to the uniform sampling approach due to decreased efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea 3 - Density-based Proportionate Cluster Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "An inherent danger with loss-based informativeness approximation is the potential for skewing the dataset towards harder examples, which could make the dataset less representative of general tasks. While loss can be considered a related indicator, it is not a direct measure of informativeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a step back with this insight, we should re-focus that MiniPile's goal is to capture the most representative subset of the 'insights' gainable from the original Pile dataset. To achieve that, we can look at diversity, which could improve generalization, especially when requiring broad informational coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, sampling inversely proportional to the cluster density will prioritize sparse regions of the dataset and thus the gaining of a broad coverage of the dataset's information. However, as lunch is never free, over-sampling/representing sparse clusters will likely introduce noise, especially when cluster sparsity correlates with low-quality examples. One could argue that we already excluded the most uninteresting, thus noise-inducing clusters, but the potential for noise itself is in no way mitigated (/mitigatable?). Density-based sampling therefore has to be understood as a trade-off between spread for representation and accidental capturing of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "And still, density-based sampling could be helpful in capturing a most diverse set of examples, which in turn could be beneficial for generalization.\n",
    "But, we have to find a way to mitigate noise and over-representation at least to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "I therefore propose a density-based sampling approach that calculates cluster contribution proportions like so:\n",
    "$$\\text{Cluster Proportion} = \\frac{|C_i|}{|\\bigcup_{j} C_j|} \\cdot (1 - \\omega \\cdot \\rho(C_i))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $|C_i|$ is the number of documents in cluster $i$, $|\\bigcup_{j} C_j|$ is the total number of documents in all clusters, and $\\rho(C_i)$ is the density of cluster $i$. The impact of the density is scaled by the hyperparameter $\\omega$, reducing the factor of over-representation of thoroughly sparse clusters.<br>\n",
    "I set $\\omega = 0.5$ with the intention of having neither cluster size nor density completely dominate the proportion calculation.\n",
    "\n",

    "A fourth idea, named HESS, aims to improve the dataset creation process entirely without the need for a proxy model."
