We exclude 38 out of the 220 clusters.
The rationales for excluding such clusters are as follows:  
• Near-duplicate documents will contain repetitions, which have been shown to degrade model performance [33, 21, 1].
• Pornography may contain sexist spurious correlations and enforce racial/social stereotypes [9, 59].
• Webpage navigation bars/product specifications/long named entity lists entail long-tail knowledge, which is challenging to learn even for large language models up to 176B parameters [28].

k=440 -> 76 clusters to exclude:
